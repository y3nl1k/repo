#indentation in Python is very important
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")


#Variables in Python:
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"


#Comments in Python:
#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")


#statements
print("Hello World!")
print("Have a good day.")
print("Learning Python is fun!")


#statements on one line by separating them with ;
print("Hello"); print("How are you?"); print("Bye bye!")

#Best practice: Put each statement on its own line so your code is easy to understand!
