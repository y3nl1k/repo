#Print a message based on whether the condition is True or False by comparing:

a = 200
b = 33

if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
else:
  print("b is not greater than a")


#When you compare two values, the expression is evaluated and Python returns the Boolean answer:

print(10 > 9)
print(10 == 9)
print(10 < 9)
